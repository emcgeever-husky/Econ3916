Project Title: Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

Objective: To empirically test the Law of One Price and identify currency misalignments using the "Burgernomics" standard.

Data Source: The Economist Big Mac Index (Raw Data), accessed via GitHub.

Methodology:

    Ingested raw CSV data using Python/Pandas.
    Calculated implied Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates based on the ratio of local burger prices to the US baseline.
    Computed percentage over/under-valuation of global currencies against the US Dollar.

Key Findings:

    The data (Jan 2015) suggests the Norwegian Krone is significantly overvalued (+X%), while the Chinese Yuan appears undervalued, reflecting the Balassa-Samuelson effect.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
